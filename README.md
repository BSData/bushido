## Overview ##
[Overview]: #overview
BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe, NewRecruit, or any other company/publisher.
If you want to help develop, take a look at [their homepage][BSData.net]

These datafiles contain all the profile information publicly available for [GCT Studios'](https://gctstudios.com/) Bushido tabletop miniatures skirmish game.
Check out the (sometimes updated) development roadmap on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/lCoAntEk/bushido-battlescribe-repository), or use the battlescribe-data channel in the [Bushido Discord](https://discord.gg/SbSBDhK) server to discuss the catalogue development.

### How to get started ###
I recommend heading to [newrecruit.eu](https://www.newrecruit.eu/) and either using their web app, or installing their app. It is in active development, unlike the official BattleScribe app. The Bushido data can be installed within the app.

## Bushido Repository Design ##
[Bushido]: #bushido 
Think of each root entry as a card. This means that you only ever select one of almost any card. Multiple-model cards, when added, will usually have one model automatically nested within them. To add a second model, you will need to go into that card's options and add one. Their equipment will then be nested within each model.

### Looking for Enhancements on multi-model cards? ###
Tap on their name! Equipment? Tap on that!
