### What's this? ###

BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher.

These datafiles contain all the profile information publicly available for [GCT Studios][]' Bushido tabletop miniatures skirmish game.
Check out the development roadmap on [Trello][].

If you want to help develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][].

### Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files. ###

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][].
Android and PC users are recommended to use the [BSData Gallery][] data-updating method to avoid AppSpot stability issues.

### Found a bug or have another request? ###

Great, thank you! Please [Report a bug][bug report] - you can also suggest enhancements and raise other issues there.
Alternatively, use the Battlescribe channel in the [Bushido Discord][] server to discuss the catalogue development.
